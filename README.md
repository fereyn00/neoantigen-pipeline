# Neoantigen Discovery Pipeline

This Nextflow pipeline processes somatic mutations and ranks neoantigen candidates using peptide-MHC binding, NetChop cleavage scores, and expression-derived weighting.

## Workflow

1. Build mutated protein sequences from each sample MAF.
2. Generate mutation-overlapping 8-14mer peptides.
3. Run NetChop per transcript FASTA.
4. Split NetMHCpan work by HLA allele and peptide chunk.
5. Combine NetChop, NetMHCpan, and expression data into one final scored candidate table.

The final published result is written to `output/`.

## Inputs

By default, place one sample MAF per file in:

```text
data/mafs/<sample_id>.csv
```

Place the matching HLA alleles in:

```text
data/netmhcpan_input/<sample_id>_hla.txt
```

Place the matching expression table in:

```text
data/expressions/<sample_id>_kallisto_expressions.csv
```

For example, sample `PT1` uses:

```text
data/mafs/PT1.csv
data/netmhcpan_input/PT1_hla.txt
data/expressions/PT1_kallisto_expressions.csv
```

The sample id is taken from the MAF filename, so the HLA and expression filenames must use the same sample id.

The input locations can also be provided as run parameters:

```bash
nextflow run main.nf \
    --maf_glob "data/mafs/*.csv" \
    --hla_dir data/netmhcpan_input \
    --expression_dir data/expressions
```

## Requirements

Install the Python dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The pipeline also requires Nextflow and Docker. Download NetChop and NetMHCpan manually from (https://services.healthtech.dtu.dk/services/NetChop-3.1/) and https://services.healthtech.dtu.dk/services/NetMHCpan-4.1/ axxordingly, then place the downloaded archives in the Docker build directories:

```text
docker/netchop/netChop.tar.gz
docker/netmhcpan/netMHCpan.tar.gz
```

The workflow builds the local Docker images automatically from `docker/netchop` and `docker/netmhcpan`.

## Run

```bash
nextflow run main.nf
```

NetMHCpan chunking can be tuned at runtime:

```bash
nextflow run main.nf \
    --netmhcpan_chunk_size 2000 \
    --netmhcpan_max_forks 4
```

Increase `netmhcpan_max_forks` if the machine has enough CPU and memory for more concurrent NetMHCpan containers. Decrease `netmhcpan_chunk_size` if individual NetMHCpan tasks are still too large.

## Output

Each sample produces:

```text
output/<sample_id>_neoantigen_candidates.csv
```

The final table contains peptide metadata, HLA allele, NetChop score, IC50, expression score, component scores, and final `PeptideScore`.
